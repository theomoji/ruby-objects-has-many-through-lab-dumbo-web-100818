# - The `Genre` class needs a class variable `@@all` that begins as an empty array.
# - The `Genre` class needs a class method `.all` that lists each genre in the class
#   variable.
# - A genre should be initialized with a name and be saved in the `@@all` array.
# - The `Genre` class needs an instance method, `#songs`, that iterates through all
#   songs and finds the songs that belong to that genre.
# - The `Genre` class needs an instance method, `#artists`, that iterates over the
#   genre's collection of songs and collects the artist that owns each song.
