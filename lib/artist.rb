# **The `Artist` model:**
#
# check- The `Artist` class needs a class variable `@@all` that begins as an empty array
# - The `Artist` class needs a class method `.all` that lists each artist in the
#   class variable
# - An artist is initialized with a name and is saved in the `@@all` array.
# - The `Artist` class needs an instance method, `#new_song`, that takes in an
#   argument of a name and genre creates a new song. That song should know that it
#   belongs to the artist.
# - The `Artist` class needs an instance method, `#songs`, that iterates through all
#   songs and finds the songs that belong to that artist. Try using `select` to
#   achieve this.
# - The `Artist` class needs an instance method, `#genres` that iterates over that
#   artist's songs and collects the genre of each song.
